Cyber Portfolio
A modern, responsive portfolio web app showcasing expertise in cybersecurity, software development, and web development. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion, this portfolio features a cyberpunk-inspired design with interactive elements, 3D tilt effects, and a dynamic project showcase. Explore my projects, skills, and services, and interact with a live code playground to see my coding prowess in action.

Features

Interactive Project Showcase: Displays nine projects with tech-specific logos, 3D tilt effects, and modal popups for detailed views. Filter projects by technology (e.g., React, C#, Python).
Cyberpunk Aesthetic: Animated gradient backgrounds, neon-glow effects, and particle overlays create a futuristic vibe.
Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with smooth animations via Framer Motion.
Code Playground: Run JavaScript and Python code snippets directly in the browser using CodeMirror and Pyodide.
Skills & Services: Highlights technical skills (e.g., React, C#, SQL) and professional services like web development and cybersecurity consulting.
Contact Form: Integrated with EmailJS for direct communication (configuration required).
SEO Optimized: Uses react-helmet-async for better search engine visibility.
Performance: Lazy-loaded components, images, and memoized rendering for fast load times.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, React Parallax Tilt, React Icons
Code Editor: CodeMirror, Pyodide (for Code Playground)

VS Code: Recommended for development, with extensions like ESLint and Prettier.
Git: For cloning the repository.

Setup Instructions

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/markjptolentino/cyber-portfolio.git
cd cyber-portfolio


Install Dependencies:
npm install

If errors occur (e.g., missing modules, April 20, 2025), clear the npm cache:
npm cache clean --force
npm install


Install Required Packages:Ensure all dependencies are installed:
npm install react react-dom react-router-dom tailwindcss framer-motion react-parallax-tilt react-icons react-modal @uiw/react-codemirror codemirror @codemirror/lang-javascript @codemirror/lang-python pyodide react-helmet-async


Run the App:Start the development server:
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser to view the portfolio.

Troubleshooting:

Missing Modules: Verify package.json includes all dependencies. Re-run npm install.
Tailwind CSS Errors: Ensure tailwind.config.js and index.css are correctly set up (April 20, 2025).
Node.js Issues: Downgrade to Node.js v18.20.4 if using v22 (April 19, 2025).

Customization

Update Projects:

Edit src/components/Projects.jsx to add new projects or update existing ones (e.g., Final SQL Assignment, PackageApp).
Example:{
  title: 'New Project',
  description: 'Description of the new project.',
  tech: ['TypeScript', 'React'],
  link: 'https://github.com/markjptolentino/new-project',
  image: '/assets/new-project.png',
  logo: <FaReact className="text-cyan-400" />,
  githubStars: '10',
  githubForks: '5',
}




Change Logos:

Replace react-icons with custom images in Projects.jsx:logo: <img src="/assets/custom-logo.png" alt="Logo" className="w-8 h-8" />


Update public/assets/ with new logo files.


Modify Theme:

Adjust colors in index.css (e.g., change neon-glow to pink: shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(255,0,255,0.5)]).
Update gradients in Projects.jsx (e.g., from-purple-800 via-pink-700 to-blue-900).


Add Screenshots:

Replace the placeholder screenshot in README.md with a real portfolio image:![Portfolio Screenshot](./public/assets/portfolio-screenshot.png)





Deployment
Deploy to Vercel for a live portfolio:

Install Vercel CLI:
npm install -g vercel


Deploy:
